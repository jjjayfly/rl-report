\section{Introduction of Deep Reinforcement Learning}

\section{Motivation and Target}

We notice that Hong Kong faced a very complex traffic situation than many other cities, even supercities like Shenzhen or Washington. Roads here are much narrow and sinuous, and some segments are located between mountain and sea. The very high density of buildings makes it possible that pedestrians suddenly appear from any horizontal direction, not to say wild pigs and other animals.

We try to simulate the traffic situation of HK, and 'build' a self-driving car, deploy RL algorithms to help it driving to the target terminal point safe and as quickly as possible.
